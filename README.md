# FOODIE

> This is a redesign of bon appetits recipe page. This project was worked on with two other team mates during Hack Reactor (HRR45). It is broken up into the three modules listed below. They are all combined onto this proxy server to make one Application.

## Related Projects

> I've included all of these modules locally so you only need to clone this one repo.
